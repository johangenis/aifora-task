# Aifora take-home task

Write a Python Rest-Service which takes input requests of the form "test\_request.json". (Part of the files in this repository.)

And yields responses of the form "test\_response.json". (Part of the files in this repository.)

Provide a suitable way to start the service locally.

The task is succesfully completed if the provided curl_request.txt (Part of the files in this repository.) - yields a valid response. The actual optimization logic is not important
for this task and all short cuts are allowed.

## Local Setup

1. `pip install poetry`
2. Install dependencies:Â `cd` into the directory where the `pyproject.toml` is located then `poetry install`
3. Run the FastAPI server via poetry `poetry run ./run.sh`
4. Open <http://localhost:8001/docs>
5. Click the 'POST' buttons to send POST requests to the API
6. Click the 'GET' buttons to send GET requests to the API
7. Use the supplied test\_response.json and test\_reply.json as request body inputs to the requests
8. It is noted that curl\_request.txt returned a valid response when tested
